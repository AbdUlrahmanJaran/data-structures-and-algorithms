# Singly Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Challenge
Create a Linked List class that contain three methods:
1. ``Insert`` : to Insert a new Node.
2. ``Includes`` : to see if the List include a Node with a specific value.
3. ``ToString`` : to Output the LinkedList.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Insert method time complixity is O(1)
- Includes method time complixity is O(n)
- ToString method time complixity is O(n)

## API
``Insert`` : Takes value as a String and return nothing.
<br>

``Includes`` : Takes value as a String and return True or False.

<br>

``To String`` : didn't take any thing and return a Linked List as a String.
