# Challenge Summary
Find common values in 2 binary trees.
Write a function called ``tree_intersection`` that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency
``HashTableInsert`` and ``HashTableContains`` depends on PreOrder traversal of a tree so Time complexity for them is O(n).

## Solution
To find common values in 2 binary trees you could write:
``TreeIntersection.Tree_Intersection(FirstTree, SecondTree).ForEach(Console.WriteLine);``
